[AISys](https://pooyanjamshidi.github.io/AISys/) is the Artificial Intelligence and Systems Laboratory in the department of Computing Science and Engineering at University of South Carolina.

<p style="text-align:justify">
We investigate a variety of open problems that sit at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer systems. We investigate the development of novel algorithmic and theoretically principled methods that are grounded in mathematics for systems problems with the ultimate goal of building reliable and high-performance machine learning systems. On the application side, we aim to develop the next generation of autonomous systems (on-device, embedded, heterogeneous, cloud, robotics) that can perceive, reason, and react to complex real-world environments and users with high levels of precision and efficiency. Overall, we aim to conduct cutting-edge and high-impact research through full-stack approaches that encourage lab members with skills in algorithms, systems, and math to solve critical and practical challenges at the intersection of AI+Systems.
